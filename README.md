## :v: About me

- Passionate for research, learning, and teaching.
- Eager to create impact by understanding processes, building on them, and improving the status quo.
- <b>Researching Consumer Education</b> - In our fast-moving and quickly developing world, people easily get left behind. New business models, large quantities of accessible information and data, and volatile technology-centric financial products are hard to keep up with. Additionally, rapidly evolving environmental and societal challenges change the way companies understand their own role in societies. I try to help businesses understand how to be good educators for their customers.
